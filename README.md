Hey! I am a full-stack software engineer who enjoys building software that solves real world problems. I am very excited to apply my experience and interests into creating projects that will have a positive impact on the world. Some things I enjoy doing in my free time include cooking, going to the gym, snowboarding, and playing chess.
