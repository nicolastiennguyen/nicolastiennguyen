Hey! I'm a software engineer who enjoys building applications that solve real world problems. I'm very excited to apply my experience and interests into creating software that will have a positive impact on the world. In my free time, you can find me cooking, snowboarding, at the gym, or probably playing with my dog. Feel free to chat with me or email me at nicolastiennguyen@gmail.com.
